Search Engine optimization wasn't click-responsive, I made it click-responsive by adding the div id that was missing instead of just the class that was present.
I changed the title of the website which is "Horiseon", the companie's name instead of just "website".
I added the alt attribute to the images as needed.

The width and height of the demo images were added accordgingly to align with each other. Also, I made the online reputation section to float-left instead of right to align with the rest. In my opinion, I felt like the design outlook was much better.

Hero: section, I changed the height from 800px to 400px
